# DIAMOND BLUEPRINTER

EVM Compatible Smart Contract Creator that uses Audited On-Chain EIP-2535
Smart Contracts as blueprints that you can use to build your own smart contracts.  

[EIP-2535: Diamonds, Multi-Facet Proxy](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535)

## Summary
The EIP-2535 smart contracts are extensible without having to redeploy existing functionality. 
Parts of a diamond can be added / replaced / removed while leaving other parts alone. 
They can be immutable or mutable. The EIP-2535 Standard enables people to write 
smart contracts with virtually no size limit, standardizes contract interfaces and 
makes interoperability easier to achieve.

The Diamond Blueprinter dynamically creates EIP-2535 Smart Contracts using existing on-chain and audited EIP-2535 
facets. Using our plug-and-play system, you can create custom contracts that meet your exact needs using battle tested on-chain assets.

## Problem
The most frequently cited deficiency in Web3 Development made by Web3 Developers in 
the [G7 Industry Report](#) was the lack of commonly used smart contracts that be 
easily resourced by common use cases that were secure and battle tested. 

## Solution
The creation of hundreds of On-chain EIP-2535 Diamond Facets that act as battle tested
function libraries. These functions and their addresses are stored in an accessible format such as a 
database and made available to the Diamond Blueprinter. 

The Diamond Blueprinter organizes these functions as commonly used contracts that meet common use cases
yet still allows the developer to further customize the contract to meet their specific 
needs.   

### Facet
Facets are Reusable and Composable. A deployed facet can be used by any number of diamonds.

Different combinations of facets can be used with different diamonds.

It is possible to create and deploy a set of facets that are reused by different diamonds over time.

The ability to use the same deployed facets for many diamonds reduces deployment costs.

A limitation is that two external functions with the same function signature canâ€™t be added to a diamond at the same 
time because a diamond, or any contract, cannot have two external functions with the same function signature.

A facet defines external functions and can define or use internal functions, libraries, and state variables.

A facet can declare state variables in structs. Each struct is given a specific position in contract storage. This technique is called Diamond Storage.


## Getting Started
The prototype will consist of the following functionality:
* **Create and Launch** (on-chain) 50 EIP-2535 Diamond Facets that contain commonly used, battle tested functions that would be useful for creating a prototype.
* **Test** facets with the [Bugout Facet Inspector](https://github.com/bugout-dev/inspector-facet)
* **Store** all functions, used in the facets, in a data store that is friendly to recommendation engines.
* **Store** additional metadata required for contract assembly and correlate with stored functions.
* **Pre-assemble** a small number of contracts that can be used for common use cases and make them searchable.
* **Create** basic platform with rest / graphql api endpoints using the G7 Microservice Platform Boilerplate
* **Tie** api endpoints into models and generate needed queries
* **Create** a super simple UI/UX that allows:
  * Build ability to search for exiting contracts based on use case query. _(list query)_
  * Build ability to select a contract from the search results. _(profile query)_
  * Once selected, build ability to display a single contact and it's analytics. 
  * From the single contract display, build ability to query additional functions. _(list query)_
  * From the single contract display, build ability to select a function and add it to the contract. _(profile query)_
  * Build the ability to create a blank contract and build the ability to add functions to it using above functionality.
  * Build ability to test the contract locally using [Bugout Facet Inspector](https://github.com/bugout-dev/inspector-facet). Add slither as additional testing option.
  * Build ability to launch the contract into a testnet and run the tests again.
